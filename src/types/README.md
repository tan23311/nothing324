# Types

The **`types`** directory contains TypeScript types and interfaces that define the structure of data used throughout the application. These types are commonly used for requests, responses, and other shared structures in the app.

## Purpose

The **`types`** folder is responsible for providing reusable and consistent type definitions that ensure type safety across the application. These types are designed to be used across multiple components, services, and utilities.

## Structure

The **`types`** directory is organized as follows:

- **General types**: Types that are used globally in the application, such as primitive data types (string, number, etc.) and shared utility types.
- **Request and Response types**: Interfaces that define the structure of data sent to and received from APIs.
- **Component types**: Type definitions specific to components to ensure the correct usage of props, states, and events.
